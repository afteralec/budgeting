# Order of Operations: Extension
# 1. X Build the Category object and table
# 2. X Link Expense to Category and Category to Budget
# 4. X Add more exit options to every menu
# 5. X Trade the prompt.yes? for a prompt.select
# 6. Get this to run as a bash exe instead of needing the ruby keyword
# 7. Look at building helper methods for the menus

# Thoughts:
# 1. Spin Wallet out from under Budget
  # + This would mean that transactions' belongs_to needs to account for different budgets
# 2. When building Category, we have to deal with what month we're budgeting for
# 3. Some of the menus need a little color and to make it clear what we're selecting

#Some notes on flow of the interface:

# X Welcome the user, ask if they're new here
# X + If new, go to user creation, then sign in
# X - If not, ask for their email
# X - (STRETCH) ask for their password
# X When they sign in, create an instance of the User class from their data in the db - this is our user
# X (STRETCH) Add an option here to check what budget they currently have open, saved to the db

# X Option menu for opening an existing budget or creating new > this goes to Budget Menu

# X Budget Menu: (Currently this is just creating bank accounts and logging transactions)
# X + Wallet (bank_accounts)

# X +> Wallet
#  X + Add New Bank Account > This goes to 'Add New Bank Account' flow
#  X + Options for each existing bank account > This goes to 'View Bank Account' flow

# X Add New Bank Account
# X + Bank Name:
# + (STRETCH) Do You Want to Link This Account?
#  + (STRETCH) Y > this goes to Link Account menu (NOT BUILT)
#  + (STRETCH) N > this skips to the next option
# X + Starting Balance:
# X (COMPLETION) Created! > Goes back to 'Wallet' menu

# X View Bank Account
# X + Bank Name, Current Balance
# + (STRETCH) Alert when unapproved transactions

# X + List of last five transactions

# X View Full Transaction History Menu
# X + 'Back to Bank Account' option at the top
# X + Scroll Down
# X - Scroll Up
# X ++ Print a log of transactions

# (STRETCH) Reconcile Account dialog
# ? (STRETCH) Is the current balance of your account X?
